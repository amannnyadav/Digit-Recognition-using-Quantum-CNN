# Digit Recognition using Hybrid Quantum CNN

## Description

This project implements a hybrid quantum convolutional neural network (CNN) for digit recognition, combining classical and quantum computing techniques. It utilizes PennyLane to create a quantum device for feature extraction and preprocesses the MNIST dataset from Keras.

## Features

- **Model Architecture:** A hybrid quantum CNN architecture is used for digit recognition.
- **Data Preprocessing:** MNIST dataset is preprocessed with 8000 images for training and 2000 images for testing.
- **Training:** The model achieves an accuracy of almost 80% within 100 epochs.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, along with overall accuracy and macro-average metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- PennyLane
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Sklearn
